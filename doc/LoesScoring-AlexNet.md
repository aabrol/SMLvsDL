Loes Scoring using AlexNet
==========================

Loes Scoring
------------

The Loes score is an adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) MRI score, which rates the severity of white matter lesions and ranges from 0 (normal) â€“ 34 (abnormal) [12]. MRI's were scored by two independent physicians (IH and MS). The physicians were blinded to the neuropsychological test results.

34 distinct parts of the brain are examined (through MRIs) for evidence of ALD.
Each section is given a score of 0 or 1 depending on the abscence or presence
of the disease in that region.

AlexNet
-------

AlexNet is the name of a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, designed by Alex Krizhevsky in collaboration with Ilya Sutskever and Geoffrey Hinton, who was Krizhevsky's Ph.D. advisor.

Method
------

We train an instance of AlexNet to predict the Loes score *in toto* rather than piece-by-piece.
